# Overview

This app calls the Meaning Cloud Natural Language Processing API to analyze text for sentiment from a website selected by the user. Users are requested to enter a valid URL which is then relayed to the language processing API and a return from the API is displayed on the page in a scores section.  The API grades the text at the user selected website for trait scores such as "irony", "confidence" or "agreement" etc.
